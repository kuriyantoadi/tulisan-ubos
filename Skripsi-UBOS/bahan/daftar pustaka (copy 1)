Most of this chapter, and indeed most of the book, discusses Knoppix in
terms of its default KDE desktop. However, Knoppix includes a number of
other desktop environments on both the CD and DVD that provide differ-
ent approaches to desktop management. In this hack, I will cover some of
the more prominent desktop environments that Knoppix has available and
how to use them.
As discussed in [Hack #4] , the desktop cheat code allows you to choose which
desktop for Knoppix to use. For instance, to boot into Fluxbox, type the fol-
lowing at the boot: prompt:
knoppix desktop=fluxbox
If you have already booted Knoppix, you can change the desktop without
rebooting. Just click K menu ➝ KNOPPIX ➝ Choose / Restart Knoppix
Desktop and choose the desktop to use from the window that appears.
While all of the desktop environments I will mention are available on the
DVD, only a few were able to fit on the CD, so I will first talk about the
desktop alternatives for the CD, and then follow up with the choices for the
DVD.
